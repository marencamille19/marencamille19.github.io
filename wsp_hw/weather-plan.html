        <h1>Weather Site Plan</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of <strong><i>The Weather Site</i></strong> is to give current weather conditions in 3 different
            ways. The initial page will give the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding location
            information from the device. The second is weather for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated
            link, and the third is weather for any location determined by a search string.</p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30. Most will be students. Access to the site will be split between
            mobile devices and laptops. A secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather.</p>
        <h3>Audience Goals:</h3>
        <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions for
            their current location as they head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes so the
            ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location is important as well. The third goal deals
            with planning for travels...the ability to get weather conditions for any location will help with last
            minute packing for road trips.</p>
        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p><img src="images/joecool.jpg" alt="black and white dog wearing a shirt that says joe cool"></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Joe Cool</li>
            <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> student</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Eternally 18</li>
            <li><strong>Interests:</strong> Traveling, Flying, Play acting, Eating</li>
            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Joe is not into planning. His last minute scrambling, whether it is
                getting to class in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure, has left hin unprepared for
                weather conditions many times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain and snow). He would like to be more
                prepared...without having to put much effort into it...or planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices, he will most often
                be found on a smart phone however. Many of the places he frequents do not have great signalâ€¦he is often
                dealing with 3G speeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>All weather pages should include location name, current temperature, forecast high, forecast low, current
            weather descriptor, forecast percentage of precipitation, and current wind speed and direction on small
            devices and hourly temps should be added on larger screens. The pages of the <i><strong>Weather Site</strong></i>
            will be built in the following order:</p>
        <h3>Pages</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Franklin and Greenville</strong> weather for each specific location. The weather for these
                pages should be pulled from the weather.JSON file that will be provided.</li>
            <li><strong>Current: </strong>weather for the current location. Current location should be determined by
                using the Geolocation API of the browser. This information should be passed to the National Weather
                Service (NWS) API to retrieve the current conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Search: </strong>Begins with only a search box, characters entered will cause a list of
                suggested matches to appear. Selected location will pull up the weather.</li>
        </ol>
